    <h3>HOBBIES</h3>
    <P>I think most of us have different hobbies at different stages of our life.
        when i was in my primary schooling playing Cricket was my favorite and i'm a big fan of movies,Those days we are not having fancy phones or internet easily available.So, television channels played a important role. Until i complete my schooling theses are my regular hobbies. When i started my 11th i used to play lot of video games, if you ask me to play 24/7 i'm ready for that.But things changed when im entered engineering. Within 3 months of joining of my college i lost interest to play video games but i started to read lot of personal development books and watch lot of personal development videos. <br>
        Some of my fav books are 
        <ol><li>The Habit of Winning</li>
        <li>How to win friends and influence people</li>
    <li>The Gretness guide</li>
<li>Rich Dad Poor Dad</li>
<li>Monk who sold his Ferrari</li></ol>
 </P>

 <h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>
 <p>From my engineering second year i was involved in a personal development industry, Through that platform i got a oppurtunity to travel india and meet lot of amazing Students. In that project initially i have learnt manythings about life and business later i have taught many students about presentation skills, Communication skills, Importance of Rigth Attitude and many Life skills which are very important to survive in the competative market. These skills are very essential becuase we know that Our Financial Success depend only 10% on Technical skills but 90% on Life Skills.</p>
